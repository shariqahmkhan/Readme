# Disclaimer:
The code is not completely mine but I couldn't find the origin from where I took it for my project. Below it describes what this project was and what I changed it

# Before
> WiFi AP mode and handles SSID and password

# After (what I added)
> Read value from EEPROM
> Update WiFi ssid and password and reconnect
